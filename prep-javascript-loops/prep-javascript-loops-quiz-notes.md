## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  Once evaluated, the condition expression determines whether or not a loop will run.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  Before the loop starts to run.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  After initialization, but still before the loop starts to run.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  After each iteration of the loop.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  To change the variable of initialization so that it eventually fails the condition
  so that the loop stops running (and is therefore not infinite).

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
  For...in loops should be used with objects.
